# Current status:

- Under development. See/regester issues, [here](https://github.com/SINTEF/pyopia/issues)

----
# Development targets for PyOpia:

1) Allow nonfamiliar users to install and use PyOpia, and to contribute & commit code changes
2) Not hardware specific
3) Smaller dependency list than PySilCam -Eventual optional dependencies (e.g. for classification)
4) Can be imported by pysilcam or other hardware-specific tools
5) Work on a single-image basis (...primarily, with options for multiprocess to be considered later)
6) No use of settings/config files within the core code - pass arguments directly. Eventual use of settings/config files should be handled by high-level wrappers that provide arguments to functions.
7) Github workflows
8) Tests

Normal functions within PyOpia should:

1) take inputs
2) return new outputs
3) don't modify state of input
4) minimum possible disc IO during processing

## Contributions

We welcome additions and improvements to the code! We request that you follow a few guidelines. These are in place to make sure the code improves over time.

1. All code changes must be submitted as pull requests, either from a branch or a fork.
2. Good documentation of the code is needed for PyOpia to succeed and so please include up-to-date docstrings as you make changes, so that the auto-build on readthedocs is complete and useful for users. (A version of the new docs will complie when you make a pull request and a link to this can be found in the pull request checks)
3. All pull requests are required to pass all tests before merging. Please do not disable or remove tests just to make your branch pass the pull request.
4. All pull requests must be reviewed by a person. The benefits from code review are plenty, but we like to emphasise that code reviews help spreading the awarenes of code changes. Please note that code reviews should be a pleasant experience, so be plesant, polite and remember that there is a human being with good intentions on the other side of the screen.
5. All contributions are linted with flake8. We recommend that you run flake8 on your code while developing to fix any issues as you go. We recommend using autopep8 to autoformat your Python code (but please check the code behaviour is not affected by autoformatting before pushing). This makes flake8 happy, and makes it easier for us all to maintain a consistent and readable code base.

## Docstrings

Use the NumPy style in docstrings. See style guide [here](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#documenting-classes)

# Installing

## For users

Users are expected to be familiar with Python. Please refer to the recommended installation instructions provided on the documentation pages, [here](https://pyopia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing)

## For developers from source

Install [Python](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download) version 3.10.

A prompt such as is provided by the [miniforge installation](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/#download) may be used for the following:

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to install pyopia using the 'cd' command.

If you use git:
Download repository from github, and move into the new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SINTEF/pyopia.git
cd pyopia
```

For the next steps, you need to be located in the directory that contains the file 'environment.yml'.

1. (optional, but recommended) Create a virtual environment using the environment.yml. This will create an environment called pyopia, but with no dependencies installed. Dependencies are managed by poetry (in step 2):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
and activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate pyopia
```

2. Install dependencies using poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

Optional dependecies (for classification), can be installed like this:

```bash
poetry install --extras "classification"
```

or for arm/silicon systems:

```bash
poetry install --extras "classification-arm64"
```

Note: If poetry spends ages resolving dependencies, you can install a development environment with pip, like this: `pip install -e ".[classification]"` or for arm/silicon: `pip install -e ".[classification-arm64]"`


3. (optional) Run local tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

#### Version numbering

The version number of PyOPIA is split into three sections: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

* MAJOR: Changes in high-level pipeline use and/or data output that are not backwards-compatible.
* MINOR: New features that are backwards-compatible.
* PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes or enhancements to existing functionality
