==================================

More will come here soon. In the meantime, have a look at the [notebooks](https://github.com/SINTEF/pyopia/tree/main/notebooks)

Some good examples of how to use {class}`pyopia.pipeline.Pipeline` for silcam can be found for SilCam [here](https://github.com/SINTEF/pyopia/blob/main/notebooks/single-image-stats.ipynb) and holographic analysis [here](https://github.com/SINTEF/pyopia/blob/main/notebooks/pipeline-holo.ipynb).
