Welcome to PyOpia's documentation!
==================================

This is documentation, auto-generated by Sphinx, for the PyOpia Ocean Particle Image Analysis toolbox, hosted by `SINTEF Ocean <https://www.sintef.no/en/ocean/>`_, in collaboration with University of Plymouth, NTNU, The MBA, and National Oceanography Center (Southampton). We hope to encourage wider collaboration on analysis tools for ocean particles and welcome new contributors!

PyOpia started in Feb. 2022 as a 'spin-off' from elements of `PySilCam <https://github.com/SINTEF/PySilCam/wiki>`_ that could be relevant for other hardware and image types, including holography.

The code repository for PyOpia can be found `here <https://github.com/SINTEF/PyOpia/>`_.
